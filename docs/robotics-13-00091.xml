      <abstract>
        <p>Because they are safe and easy to use, collaborative robots are revolutionizing many sectors, including industry, medicine, and agriculture. Controlling their dynamics, movements, and postures are key points in this evolution. Inverse kinematics is then crucial for robot motion planning. In 6R serial robots, achieving a desired pose is possible with different joint combinations. In this paper, our focus lies in studying forward and, mainly, inverse kinematics of the FANUC CRX-10iA cobot, a 6R cobotic arm with a non-spherical wrist. Its specific structural parameters implies that no analytical solutions exist except for some particular situations. FANUC does not provide the complete set of inverse kinematic solutions, even when 16 solutions are possible, only 8 of them are provided in Roboguide software. Furthermore, the existing literature on joints-to-workspace mapping for CRX cobots is currently very limited. It either lacks or provides partial or inconsistent inverse kinematics analysis. We present and detail a novel fully geometric method for numerically solving inverse kinematics meeting the requirement of high precision and a fast response. This approach provides both the exact number of inverse kinematics solutions and the sets of joint angles even for singular configuration. Its effectiveness was verified through simulations using the Roboguide Software and experimentation on the actual CRX-10iA cobot. Several examples (8, 12, or 16 inverse kinematic solutions) have enabled us to validate and prove the robustness and reliability of this geometric approach.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>From industrial manufacturing to the medical field, robotics is nowadays being used in all the important sectors of life and society. The use of robots in the medical field is becoming increasingly prevalent, revolutionizing operating rooms around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-robotics-13-00091">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-robotics-13-00091">2</xref>]. Over the past decade, there has been a notable emergence of collaborative robots (cobots) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-robotics-13-00091">3</xref>]. Consequently, cobots are being utilized more frequently to assist or even conduct delicate surgeries, offering the potential for faster, more precise, and less risky interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-robotics-13-00091">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Robotics manufacturers offer for instance promising cobotic modalities for many medical applications. The UR3 from Universal Robots, a 6R cobot, was used for a tele-robotic ultrasound solution for remote diagnostic echography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-robotics-13-00091">5</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-robotics-13-00091">6</xref>], authors used another 6R cobot, the TX2 60 from St&#xE4;ubli company, for the comanipulation of an ultrasound probe. Furthermore, a FANUC cobot, the CRX-10<italic>i</italic>A, was used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-robotics-13-00091">7</xref>] to present a study regarding the design and the experimental setup of a cobotic system for targeted drug delivery in the inner ear, where a dedicated magnetic probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-robotics-13-00091">8</xref>] had to be controlled in position and orientation, as computed based on MRI pre-operative images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-robotics-13-00091">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>To perform these different tasks and more, the knowledge of the robot&#x2019;s kinematics is most often required. Due to the interesting but complex nature of robots control, several approaches to the research of kinematic models (both Forward and Inverse) have been taken. The most challenging task for most cases is still Inverse Kinematics (IK) computing.</p>
      <p>While classical methods such as those of Pieper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-robotics-13-00091">10</xref>] or Paul [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-robotics-13-00091">11</xref>] can be applied to compute Inverse Kinematic solutions for St&#xE4;ubli or, respectively, UR cobots mentioned above, they cannot be applied to the CRX series because of their kinematic architecture. Indeed, since 1968, Pieper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-robotics-13-00091">10</xref>] showed that a literal IK model can be defined for 6R robots with a spherical wrist. Up to eight solutions can be computed. In 1981, Paul [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-robotics-13-00091">11</xref>] proposed an approach for solving IK of certain 6R robots, with a non-spherical wrist, that consists of successively multiplying the two sides of the Forward Kinematic (FK) equations by transformation matrices and thus isolate the joint values one after another. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-robotics-13-00091">12</xref>], authors used this approach for solving the IK of the UR5 cobot: a 6 DoF mechanism with a non-spherical wrist, where J2, J3 and J4 axes are parallel. This robot, and all of the UR series, have four or eight inverse kinematic solutions, depending on the desired pose in the workspace.</p>
      <p>For CRX cobots series, the 6R cobotic arm has a non-spherical wrist with perpendicular axes of J2 and J3. Thus, analytical IK solutions cannot be provided and are only available for some special cases. In this case, IK solutions can be computed, based on algebraic or geometric approaches, using numerical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-robotics-13-00091">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-robotics-13-00091">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-robotics-13-00091">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-robotics-13-00091">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>For over 30 years, researchers have dealt with inverse kinematics problems. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-robotics-13-00091">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-robotics-13-00091">18</xref>], authors has addressed the inverse kinematics problem of 6 DoF manipulators and proposed a simplification process to analytically solve inverse kinematic equations if all adjoining joint axes are parallel or orthogonal. However, no analytical solution of the inverse kinematics applicable to arbitrary structures is available. They have presented, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-robotics-13-00091">19</xref>], an iterative inverse kinematic approach based on the Newton&#x2013;Raphson method that can be applied to manipulators requiring a numerical technique. This approach led them to discover that a 6 DoF manipulator is able to reach an end-effector pose (position and orientation) in 16 different configurations. It was also shown in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-robotics-13-00091">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-robotics-13-00091">21</xref>], by an algebraic approach, proposed by Raghavan and Roth, that inverse kinematics solutions can be determined by a 16th degree univariate polynomial, which means up to 16 IK solutions, for 6R serial manipulators, can be computed. However, these general approaches suffer from numerical inaccuracies in several configurations. Therefore, researchers have been studying possible improvements and generalization of these approaches ever since [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-robotics-13-00091">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-robotics-13-00091">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-robotics-13-00091">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-robotics-13-00091">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-robotics-13-00091">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-robotics-13-00091">27</xref>].</p>
      <p>Solving IK of CRX cobots series of FANUC remains challenging. Their architecture leads to 16 IK solutions. In fact, the degrees of characteristic polynomials depend on the structural design parameters of 6 DoF robotic arms (adjacent parallel, perpendicular, or intersecting axes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-robotics-13-00091">28</xref>]. Different approaches have been shown to solve this issue. A differential control was used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-robotics-13-00091">7</xref>] to solve IK positioning of a CRX cobot. This approach presents some inherent limitations. Indeed, finding an efficient initial pose for convergence while avoiding singularities during motion are still factors that affect or limit its applicability. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-robotics-13-00091">29</xref>], authors present an iterative approach that bypasses the use of Jacobian and rotational matrices, it is based on several iterations through each joint, starting with the last joint (end-effector position) and connecting it to the first one. This method does not consider the end-effector orientation; moreover, it can be stuck in a local optimum leading to it being unable to find a global optimum. Kucuk et al. proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-robotics-13-00091">30</xref>] a numerical algorithm where the idea is to chose a random initial value for the first joint in order to reduce the IK problem to 1 DoF and then compute analytically the rest of the joint parameters. These approaches provide a valid IK solution but without mapping all possible IK solutions which prevents changing aspects to find a better configuration for the same probe position and orientation.</p>
      <p>In more recent works, an algebraic approach was used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-robotics-13-00091">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-robotics-13-00091">32</xref>] to determine IK solutions of the CRX-10<italic>i</italic>A/L, a particular cobot of the CRX series. The used methods involve solving a 16th degree univariate polynomial, which is constructed from a set of six constraint equations representing mechanism loop closures, along with the parameterization of a set of unknown variables. The authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-robotics-13-00091">31</xref>] state considering the vector of unknown variables characterizing the position of the frame attached to the fourth robot body makes the resolution possible. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-robotics-13-00091">32</xref>], authors show precisely that the 16th degree closure polynomial they obtained can be factorized in two identical 8th degree polynomials, which provides a significant simplification for zero determination. In these studies, authors have dealt with the IK problem of 6R with non-spherical wrist arms, more particularly CRX cobots; however, no attention has been given to the accuracy and efficiency of the provided IK solutions which can be an issue for exact manipulations. For instance, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-robotics-13-00091">31</xref>], the 16 given solutions of the CRX Inverse Kinematics are not completely valid on the real cobot and present pose accuracy issues. Furthermore, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-robotics-13-00091">32</xref>], an issue with the third joint values can be pointed out, distorting 8 pose configurations out of 16. Moreover, due to the simplicity of the chosen example, where J6 is vertical, an explicit inverse kinematics solution exists, thus reducing the algebraic solution interest, which is not the case for any desired pose.</p>
      <p>The motivation of this paper is thus dealing with these limits by approaching 6R manipulator IK solutions with high accuracy and effectiveness. A new inverse kinematic algorithm for the CRX-10<italic>i</italic>A cobot is presented. The proposed method is based on a geometric approach and shows to be useful for solving IK problems with high precision and efficiency. The various steps are detailed in the following, aiming to simplify the implementation process for readers interested in utilizing this method for CRX IK control. Specific examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, both through simulation on Roboguide Software and experimentation with the actual cobot.</p>

        <title>2.1. FANUC CRX Cobot</title>
        <p>The FANUC CRX-10<italic>i</italic>A is a 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) cobot with a 6R serial architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="robotics-13-00091-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Its compact design and high reliability (the constructor gives a position repeatability of 0.05 mm) allows for the easy integration into any work area making it very popular in industry and robotics research. As a collaborative robot, it is intended for applications that include human interaction. It offers then all the safety guarantees (speeds, forces) required for this purpose. In fact, its sleek design, devoid of sharp edges, and illuminated indicators are all tailored for safe interaction and collaboration with humans.</p>
        <p>The kinematics architecture of this cobot closely resemble those of classic 6R serial manipulators, in particular the original FANUC series. However, the main difference lies in the fact that the directions of J2, J3, and J4 are not parallel, which is now combined with the fact that the wrist is not spherical. These two simultaneous features considerably complicate the resolution of inverse kinematics.</p>
        <p>As of today, the FANUC CRX cobot series consists of five cobots. They may vary in size, but they all share the same kinematic architecture. This implies that the geometric approach developed in this paper can be implemented in all CRX cobots.</p>

        <title>2.2. Analysis of the 16 IK Solutions Proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-robotics-13-00091">31</xref>]</title>
        <p>As explained earlier, the specific architecture of the CRX cobot makes the resolution of its inverse kinematics challenging. Recently, authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-robotics-13-00091">31</xref>] have dealt with the inverse kinematics of this particular cobot. Authors proposed an algebraic numerical IK solutions for the CRX-10<italic>i</italic>A/L cobot. They provided a numerical example illustrating, with a particular focus on the following posture [Car<sub>#4</sub>], 16 IK solutions.</p>
        <p>A robot configuration in the joint space, also called a posture, is then denoted as [<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm2"><mml:semantics><mml:msub><mml:mi>Car</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>] (in reference to the first author L.

        <p>Then, in this paper, authors presented 15 additional postures, intended to achieve the same pose (the tool position and orientation in the task space).</p>
        <p>For the following, this notation is considered for these 16 postures [<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm5"><mml:semantics><mml:msub><mml:mi>Car</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>],   <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm6"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="3.33333pt"/><mml:mo>&#x2208;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> [1, 16].</p>
        <p>Interested in the need for inverse kinematics, we studied article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-robotics-13-00091">31</xref>] to apply its method. We thoroughly analyzed the example proposed by the authors, which illustrates a pose with 16 IK solutions, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="robotics-13-00091-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

            <p>The results obtained using this FK model have been confirmed on both the real CRX-10<italic>i</italic>A cobot and the Roboguide software. FANUC Roboguide is a robot simulator that perfectly emulates FANUC robots movements and dynamic behavior, greatly reducing the time required to create new motion configurations. Robotic cells can be designed, tested, and modified entirely offline which enables us to evaluate different configurations of the robot virtually before implementing them in a real-world setting.</p>

        <p>The inverse kinematic model provides 0, 4, 8, 12, or 16 solutions, depending on the different parameters of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm105"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>-<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm106"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>In certain exceptional configurations, intermediate numbers such as 2, 6, 10, or 14 solutions may occur, indicating the presence of &#x201C;double&#x201D; solutions.</p>
        <p>Thus, cases with 2 solutions arise when the TCP precisely aligns with the edge of the workspace (i.e., 1249.039 mm from the center <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm107"><mml:semantics><mml:msub><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p>
        <p>We will see later another scenario, where the TCP is at the the workspace center, and which entails 14 solutions, including 12 distinct solutions and 2 double solutions.</p>
        <p>When considering a <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm108"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>-<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm109"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> randomly selected within the cobot workspace, the highest probability corresponds to 8 solutions, estimated at approximately 80%.</p>
        <p>The likelihood of encountering 12 solutions is notably lower.</p>
        <p>The probability of encountering 4 or 16 solutions is even lower, approximately 5%.</p>
        <p>Please note that these statistic values are approximate, as they depend on the parameterization of the poses: Cartesian or spherical coordinates for positions, Cardan or Euler formalisms, or Quaternions for orientations. Additionally, these values may slightly differ when considering real accessible poses, accounting for the cobot joint limitations.</p>

          <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="robotics-13-00091-f009">Figure 9</xref>, two examples are presented where the curves intersect the zero line 3 or 7 times.

They exhibit behavior akin to a &#x201C;distorted sinusoidal curve&#x201D; with two alternations, thus potentially providing a maximum of 4 zeros. Identifying zeros is a classic conventional and straightforward procedure, which we will not delve into extensively in this paper as it does not present a challenge for the IK problem.</p>

      <p>In our first example, typical of the most common scenarios, we observe eight solutions. The second example presents a case with 12 solutions, while the third illustrates a pose yielding 16 solutions. This range demonstrates the model&#x2019;s versatility in addressing various poses and the number of feasible solutions it can generate.</p>

        <p>This example is particularly intriguing because, owing to its unique desired orientation, it can be solved manually without the need for inverse kinematics, relying simply on trigonometric relationships and DHm parameters.</p>
        <p>The same end-effector pose could be achieved through 12 sets of joint angles, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="robotics-13-00091-t005">Table 5</xref>.

        <p>This means that, for specific wrist configurations, there could be two solutions UP<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm342"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> and DW<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm343"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> where the configuration of the wrist in both solutions are precisely the same.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon mirrors what occurs with a spherical wrist configuration. Consequently, we can observe identical values in lines #1 and #5 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="robotics-13-00091-t005">Table 5</xref> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm344"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> = &#x2212;14.478&#xB0;) and the exact opposite values in lines #4 and #6 (<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm345"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> = + 14.478&#xB0;).</p>
        <p>Ensuring that Inverse Kinematic solutions are both reliable and accurate is essential. Equally important is the consideration of a robot&#x2019;s joint constraints.

      <title>4. Discussion and Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this paper, we discussed the CRX cobots series introduced by FANUC. After emphasizing the significance of cobotics in various applications, we proceeded to develop both Forward and Inverse Kinematic models for CRX cobots.</p>
      <p>The Forward Kinematic model that we have introduced adheres closely to the FANUC approach. It is a model designed to ascertain the pose delivered by the cobot for a given configuration, represented by the six programmed <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm360"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> values.</p>
      <p>This implies that the model developed accurately incorporates the origins and directions of the joint values, as well as the specific coupling between the <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm361"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm362"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> joints, in the Forward Kinematics calculations.</p>
      <p>We have demonstrated the potential utility of the differential approach for joint control under 6D path-planning constraints in certain specific scenarios. It is nevertheless crucial to emphasize the necessity of a complete and reliable Inverse Kinematic solution.</p>
      <p>While previous solutions have offered partial sets of equations, notably the one proposed by FANUC in Roboguide software, and others have exhibited inconsistencies, this study provides a numerical geometric approach for the inverse kinematic solution for cobotic arms with non-spherical wrists, specifically the CRX-10<italic>i</italic>A, with a particular focus on completeness and accuracy.</p>
      <p>This novel approach</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>Enables the determination of the exact number of possible joint solutions for a desired pose.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Provides the different sets of joint angles values <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm363"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> for these distinct solutions.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>Through Forward and Inverse kinematic models computing, simulations on the Roboguide software, and experiments on the real cobot CRX-10<italic>i</italic>A, we have demonstrated that the number of IK solutions can range from 2 to 16. In most cases, 8 IK solutions are valid. However, IK solutions may also occur in increments of 4, 8, 12, or 16, with occasional instances of 2, 6, 10, or 14 solutions.</p>
      <p>The technique we have developed has been experimentally validated and proven to be robust. It accurately determines the number of IK solutions corresponding to the actual valid solutions within joint limits, ensuring neither more nor fewer solutions are provided. Moreover, this method provides joint angle values with sub-millidegree accuracy in a few milliseconds, so operates rapidly and efficiently from a computational point of view.</p>
      <p>This approach can be applied to all 6R serial robots with a non-spherical wrist. For example, as part of a comparative analysis, we tested it on the Universal Robot, UR5, for which, however, an explicit IK model can be established. The results provided were consistent with the literal IK.</p>
      <p>In the continuation of this work on CRX cobots series, we will aim to characterize workspace domains with a specific number of IK solutions and define their boundaries, particularly when this number exceeds eight. Additionally, we will explore the issue of crossing these boundaries, for instance, when transitioning from a 16-solution domain to one with a 12-solution domain, and vice versa.</p>
      <p>We will also study the concept of &#x201C;aspect&#x201D; and changes in aspect, examining the link between aspect and p-solution domains. As mentioned above, we will explore the issue of transitioning between aspects and within a given aspect.</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="robotics-13-00091-f015">Figure 15</xref> highlights a particular example of this future work: transitioning from one solution to another within the same set of solutions (from <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm364"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#xA0;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#xA0;</mml:mo><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm365"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#xA0;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#xA0;</mml:mo><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>), while maintaining the same initial and final poses, without encountering any singularities during the movement.</p>
