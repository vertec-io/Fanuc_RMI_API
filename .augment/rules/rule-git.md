Do not make any commits to the codebase unless I explicitly tell you.
Do not make any commits to related codebases accessible from the file system unless I explicitly tell you.
Do not assume that because I explicitly told you to commit/push in the codebase that this authorizes future commits/pushes. Wait until I say that you are authorizes for all future commits/pushes in the active thread.
Do not assume that because I authorized commits/pushes in one thread, that it appleis to other threads. Authorizations shall be per thread/conversation.
